# credit-risk-classification

Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to evalute the performance of a logictical regression modle predicting loan labels.
  0: Healthy Loan (low risk)
  1: High Risk Loan
The analysis aim to assess how well the model can correctly identify both healthy loans (class 0) and high-risk loans (class 1). By examining key performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, we can determine if this model is suitable for making predictions in a real-world setting, such as for a lending company.

Results:
  Accuracy: 99%

  Precision for Healthy Loans (0): 100%

  Recall for Healthy Loans (0): 99%

  Precision for High-risk Loans (1): 87%

  Recall for High-risk Loans (1): 93.%

Summary:
The logistic regression model demonstrates excellent performance overall, especially in predicting healthy loans (class 0). With an accuracy score of 99%, the model is highly reliable, and its precision and recall for healthy loans (100% and 99%) show that it is adept at identifying healthy loans with minimal error.

However, for high-risk loans (class 1), the modelâ€™s precision (87%) is lower, meaning that some healthy loans are incorrectly predicted as high-risk. Despite this, the recall for high-risk loans is strong at 93%, indicating that the model does a good job of catching most high-risk loans, though some are still missed.
